                <h3>hallucinate</h3>
                <!-- The description of the work -->
                <p>This IG Filter is one of the most satisfying filter that I realized. Both for my enjoyment of the artist and for the challenge that it gave me to create artistically and technically.</p>

                <h3>mood.txt</h3>
                <p>This IG Filter was born as an experiment to try different interactions and possibility to choose meshes, blended to the possibility of make a shot which has also the real-time timestamp in which the story was recorded.</p>
                <video src="../Videos/video2.mp4" controls width="240" height="465"></video>

            <!-- The third work -->
            <div class="work">
                <h3>ⓐⓡⓘⓔⓣⓔ</h3>
                <p>This IG Filter was made after looking at a videoclip of the italian singer Ariete, the aesthetic of the video was one of my favourite ones: the old PCs' monitors. That sparked in me the idea to create a filter based on the old computers desktops.</p>

                <h3>fancyfootball</h3>
                <!-- The description of the work -->
                <p>This IG Filter was the result of a workshop held by Meta Spark. It ended up as one of the most appreciated and featured also in the Facebook group and in the official IG page of Meta and the host of the workshop.</p>

                <!-- The description of the work -->
                <p>This IG Filter was realized as a fan-tribute of the song Polly, by the italian singer Diego Naska. It was a good moment to try blending together face tracking, 3D Modeled objects ostructors, sound responsiveness and other minor features.</p>

                <!-- The description of the work -->
                <p>This IG Filter was made to realize a time-warp effect with the possibility of bidirectional choice. It was challenging to make as it required a threshold (one pixel row or column) which worked as "screenshotter" of the current photogram at each iteration.</p>

                <p>This IG Filter was the product of the sperimentation with masks, textures manipulation and world changing details.</p>
